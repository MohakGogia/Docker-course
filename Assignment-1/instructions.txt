Dockerize BOTH apps - the Python and the Node app.

1) Create appropriate images for both apps (two separate images!).
HINT: Have a brief look at the app code to configure your images correctly!

Ans-
docker build .

2) Launch a container for each created image, making sure, 
that the app inside the container works correctly and is usable.

Ans-
Node-app: simple web app listening on port 3000
=>  docker run -p 3000:3000 fbe

Python-app: cmd line app
=> docker run -it 7dd (interactive mode with cmd line terminal)

3) Re-create both containers and assign names to both containers.
Use these names to stop and restart both containers.

Ans-
Stop both containers - docker stop containername1
Delete both containers - docker rm containername1 containername2

Recreate with names-
docker run -p 3000:3000 --name node-app-mine fbe
docker run -it --name python-app-mine 7dd

Restart them -
docker stop node-app-mine
docker start node-app-mine

4) Clean up (remove) all stopped (and running) containers, 
clean up all created images.

Ans-
Delete all containers - docker rm containername1 containername2
Delete all images - docker rmi imaegeID1 imaegeID2

5) Re-build the images - this time with names and tags assigned to them.

Ans-
docker build -t node-app:latesht .
docker build -t python-app:latesht .

6) Run new containers based on the re-built images, ensuring that the containers
are removed automatically when stopped.

Ans-
docker run -d --rm -p 3000:3000 --name node-app-new node-app:latesht (or remove -d for attached mode)
docker run -it --rm --name python-app-new python-app:latesht
